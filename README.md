# Build APIs You Won't Hate #2: This Time It's Serious!

## Theory

- [ ] APIs, Services, and Microservices

- [x] Understanding Different Paradigms
  - [x] RPC
  - [x] REST
  - [ ] Query Languages

- [ ] Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)
  - [ ] Layers of abstaction on top of RPC
  - [ ] Next available actions
  - [ ] Standards (JSON:API, HAL, etc.)

- [ ] HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
  - [ ] HTTP/2 is a real world thing today use it
  - [ ] Lets Stop Building Around a Network Hack

- [ ] Asynchronous Methodologies
  - [ ] Long Polling
  - [ ] Web Hooks (a.k.a Callbacks)
  - [ ] WebSockets
  - [ ] Message Brokers (AMQP, Kafka, etc.)

- [ ] API Specifications
  - [ ] Design First vs Code First
