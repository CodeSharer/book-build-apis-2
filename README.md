# Build APIs You Won't Hate #2: This Time It's Serious!


## Theory

- RPC, REST and GraphQL
  - Technical Differences
  - When to use which

- Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)
  - Layers of abstaction on top of RPC
  - Next available actions
  - Standards (JSON:API, HAL, etc.)

- HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
  - HTTP/2 is a real world thing today use it
  - Lets Stop Building Around a Network Hack

- API Specifications
  - Design First vs Code First

## Planning & Design

## Deployment

Ugh do I have to? It's just like deploying any other application no?

Maybe Kubernetes httpGet /health

## Management

- API Gateways
- Gateway Validation
- Rate Limiting
- Governance (Speccy / Specteral / Stoplight)

## Retiring & Deprecating

- Deprecation
