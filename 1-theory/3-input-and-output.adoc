= Input and Output

Most of the whole idea of an API is "input" and "output", and in HTTP an input
comes in the form of "requests", and output comes in the form of "responses".

There's a "method" involved, and a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) also known as an "endpoint".

== Requests

.Making a GET request to the `/places` URL with some query string parameters.
[source,http]
----
GET /places?lat=40.759211&lon=-73.984638 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
----

Here `GET` is the method, and the part of the URL usually referred to as the "endpoint" is `/places`, and the query
string is `lat=40.759211&lon=-73.984638`. The HTTP version in use is HTTP/1.1,
and the host name is defined to complete the URL. This is how a request to fetch
data from `http://api.example.org/places` looks, and is almost exactly what your
browser does when you go to any website.

[source,http]
----
POST /places HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{ "some_property" : "some_value" }
----

Here we make a POST request with an "HTTP body". The `Content-Type` header
points out we are sending JSON and the blank line above the JSON separates the
"HTTP headers" from the "HTTP body". HTTP really is amazingly simple. This is
all you need to do for anything, and you can do all of this with an HTTP client
in whatever programming language you feel like using this week:

.Using PHP and the Guzzle HTTP library to make an HTTP Request
[source,php]
----
use Guzzle\Http\Client;

$headers = [
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
];
$payload = [
    'user_id' => 2
];

// Create a client and provide a base URL
$client = new Client('http://api.example.org');

$req = $client->post('/moments/1/gift', $headers, json_encode($payload));
----

.Using Python and the Requests HTTP library to make an HTTP Request
[source,python]
----
import json
import requests

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
payload = {
    'user_id': 2
}
req = requests.post(
  'http://api.example.org/moments/1/gift',
  data=json.dumps(payload),
  headers=headers
)
----

It's all the same in any language. Define your headers, define the body in an
appropriate format, and send it on its way.

There are a bunch of HTTP methods you might run into:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- TRACE

Some of these methods might look familiar from your favourite web application
frameworks routing layer.

Some frameworks like Rails push their super magical routing to abstract away
from manually declaring these routes, so if you are a Rails developer who is
unfamiliar with these routes, try typing `rails routes` to see what shows up.

There are a more HTTP methods floating around, but the idea is that they all
have very specific defined behavior. Lazy people can pick the wrong method and
misuse it, which cocks up a lot of various HTTP tools, but theoretically if used
properly tools will know what to do in a lot of scenarios you might not have
thought of.

For example, many tools will know that they can cache a GET request, but know
that caching a POST would be spooky and problematic. They will know they can
retry a PUT or a DELETE, but better not retry a PATCH. These conventions allow a
lot of tools that do not have direct knowledge of each other to work together.


=== HTTP Methods

Let's take a quick peruse through the HTTP methods.

==== GET

Just fetch some stuff. Don't trigger any destructive changes anywhere else as
result. This should be repeatable.

SIDEBAR: They can technically have a body some servers and tools will start
acting a bit wonky, meaning people generally avoid creating GETs with bodies.

==== POST

Often used purely for "creates" but can be used for any non-idempotent action.
Idempotent means you can do this thing over and over again, and it happening two
or more times won't create different outcomes.

Creating something is a good example of a non-idempotent action, because if you
send two requests to create a thing, you now have two things. You could also be
triggering the sending of an email, paying an invoice, etc., it does not have to
be a create.

==== PUT

Often incorrectly associated with being an "edit" action, PUT can actually do a
whole lot more than that. PUT is designed to be an idempotent way to send data
to a server, where the request contains the entirety of the resource. Whatever
it says should go, so if the attempt fails for any reason and the client
retries, there wil be no negative consequence as its said the same thing twice.

An example of this would be an image upload. An API might have the ability to
upload an image for a user, which is probably a profile image. A request with
`PUT /users/jane/image` and a body of either the image contents (or a JSON
payload with a URL) could then provide the image. It does not matter if the user
already had an image or not, if the request is a success they will have one. If
the upload fails that is fine, another request can be set, and it will be
overridden.

SIDEBAR: Some folks get a bit concerned about this being a "create or update"
action, but their concern comes from a misplaced sense that HTTP verbs
correspond to a specific CRUD action. If somebody complains at you about this,
politely point them at this section.

PUT is not always appropriate, and can lead to race conditions if not used
cautiously.

===== üèé Race Conditions üèé

Think about a resource represented with JSON, that has two properties:
`property1` and `property2`. After getting the initial value of the resource
with a GET request, two different HTTP clients make requests (Request A and
(Request B) to update the value of just one property via a PUT. Both `property1`
and `property2` are `false` in the original response of the GET request.

**Request A**

Updating `property1` to be true.

[source]
====
PUT /foos/123

{
  "property1": true,
  "property2": false
}
====

**Request B**

Updating `property2` to be true.

[source]
====
PUT /foos/123

{
  "property1": false,
  "property2": true
}
====

Both properties started at `false`, and both clients were only trying to update one property, but little do they know they are clobbering the results and essentially reverting the updates from other clients. Instead of ending up with both values being `true`, the API will just hold whatever the most recent request was, which is going to be `"property1": false` and `"property2": true`.

Some folks consider this to be a feature, but others consider it a bug because if they only want to update one property, why do they need to send everything? People in the second camp decide to just send the relevant properties they want to change, which is a flagrant misuse of how PUT is supposed to work and can lead to confusion with tools that expect PUT to contain an entire resource, not just partial changes.

For partial changes, there is another method.

==== PATCH

Patch is a more recent condition to HTTP, with its RFC being finalized in 2010.

[quote,Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789]
====
The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document.
This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource.
====

So if PUT is for when a client has all the answers and wants to give that
exactly to the server, PATCH is for when the client only wants to update certain
parts of the resource.

Some folks have never heard of the conflict scenario above, and recommend PATCH
because it is essentially a performance improvement. Technically they are right:
sending less stuff over the wire is quicker than sending more stuff.

How exactly PATCH works can vary on which data format you're using. If its JSON
then there are two popular approaches: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON
Patch] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch].

JSON Merge Patch is what most people will want to use for general APIs, and it is
simple to use. From the RFC:

[quote,Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396]
____

Given the following example JSON document:

  {
    "title": "Goodbye!",
    "author" : {
      "givenName" : "John",
      "familyName" : "Doe"
    },
    "tags":[ "example", "sample" ],
    "content": "This will be unchanged"
  }

A user agent wishing to change the value of the "title" member from
"Goodbye!" to the value "Hello!", add a new "phoneNumber" member,
remove the "familyName" member from the "author" object, and replace
the "tags" array so that it doesn't include the word "sample" would
send the following request:

  PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json

  {
    "title": "Hello!",
    "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890",
    "author": {
      "familyName": null
    },
    "tags": [ "example" ]
  }

The resulting JSON document would be:

  {
    "title": "Hello!",
    "author" : {
      "givenName" : "John"
    },
    "tags": [ "example" ],
    "content": "This will be unchanged",
    "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890"
  }
____

==== HEAD

Pretty much exactly the same as GET in every way, but HEAD responses must not
contain a body. This is great for checks to see if something exists, and if it
does the client does not have to wait for the entire response body to be
generated then sent down the wire.

==== DELETE

Guess what this does?!

DELETE requests _can_ contain a body, but generally do not. They are considered
idempotent like PUT, because if you are asking to delete something, and you
accidentally delete it twice, then the response both times should be "Yes this
is deleted".

Some APIs do not implement it that way so a second attempt to
delete the same thing will get a 404. That is a bit of a shame as it means
clients can get a "You cannot delete this" message when they did in fact delete
it... plan accordingly.

== Responses

Much the same as an HTTP request, your HTTP response is going to end up as plain
text (unless you're using SSL, but hang on, we aren't there yet).

.Example HTTP response containing a JSON body
[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user":{
    "id":1,
    "name":"Theron Weissnat",
    "bio":"Occaecati excepturi magni odio distinctio dolores.",
    "picture_url":"https://cdn.example.org/foo.png",
    "created_at":"2013-11-22 16:37:57"
  }
}
----

First you might notice then `200 OK`, which is a HTTP status code that says things worked as expected. No issues here buddy. Then there is the `Content-Type`, which just says the data is JSON.

=== HTTP Status Codes

A status code is a category of success or failure, with specific codes
being provided for a range of situations, that are essentially metadata
supplementing the body returned from the API.

Back in the early 2000s when AJAX was first a thing, it was far too common for
people to ignore everything other than the body, and return some XML or JSON
saying:

[source,javascript]
----
{ "success": true }
----

These days it's far more common to utilize HTTP properly, and give the
response a status code as defined in the RFC have a number from `200` to
`599` -- with plenty of gaps in between -- and each has a message and a
definition. Most server-side languages, frameworks, etc., default to
`200 OK`.

Status codes are grouped into a few different categories:, with the
first number being an identifier of the category of thing that happened.

=== 2XX is all about success

Whatever your application tried to do was successful, up to the point that the
response was sent. A `200 OK` means you got your answer, a `201 Created` means
the thing was created, and a `202 Accepted` is similar but does not say anything
about the actual result, it only indicates that a request was accepted and is
being processed asynchronously. It could still go wrong, but at the time of
responding it was all looking good so far.

=== 3XX is all about redirection

These are all about sending the calling application somewhere else for the
actual resource. The best known of these are the `303 See Other` and the `301
Moved Permanently`, which are used a lot on the web to redirect a browser to
another URL. Usually a redirect will be combined with a `Location` header to
point to the new location of the content.

=== 4XX is all about client errors

Indicate to your clients that they did something wrong. They might have
forgotten to send authentication details, provided invalid data, requested a
resource that no longer exists, or done something else wrong which needs fixing.

=== 5XX is all about service errors

With these status codes, the API, or some network component like a load
balancer, web server, application server, etc. is indicating that something went
wrong in their side. For example, a database connection failed, or another
service was down. Typically, a client application can retry the request. The
server can even specify when the client should retry, using a `Retry-After` HTTP
header.

=== Common Status Codes

Arguments between developers will continue for the rest of time over the
exact appropriate code to use in any given situation, but these are the
most important status codes to look out for in an API:

* 200 - Generic everything is OK
* 201 - Created something OK
* 202 - Accepted but is being processed async (for a video means
encoding, for an image means resizing, etc.)
* 400 - Bad Request (should really be for invalid syntax, but some folks
use for validation)
* 401 - Unauthorized (no current user and there should be)
* 403 - The current user is forbidden from accessing this data
* 404 - That URL is not a valid route, or the item resource does not
exist
* 405 - Method Not Allowed (your framework will probably do this for
you)
* 409 - Conflict (Maybe somebody else just changed some of this data, or
status cannot change from e.g: "published" to "draft")
* 410 - Data has been deleted, deactivated, suspended, etc.
* 415 - The request had a `Content-Type` which the server does not know
how to handle
* 429 - Rate Limited, which means take a breather, sleep a bit, try
again
* 500 - Something unexpected happened, and it is the APIs fault
* 503 - API is not here right now, please try again later

You might spot others popping up from time to time, so check on
http://http.cat/[http.cats] (or
http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml[iana.org]
for a more formal list) when you see one that's not familiar.

== Mime Types

HTTP APIs can work with all sorts of data. Whilst SOAP may have been restricted
to XML, REST and GraphQL can work with any response types. gRPC is kinda stuck
with Protobuf.

An API can support almost unlimited options, but of course building support for
every content type ever would be a rather laborious job. There are a few we can
cut out early on.

=== Ditch Form Data

"Form Data" uses the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` mime type, and mostly
only seems to be used by PHP developers. Luckily most other folks ignore this
wholeheartedly.

.Form data doesn't really have data types, just awkward strings.
[source]
----
foo=something&bar=1&baz=0
----

Another issue with form data is similar to how XML suffers a lack of obvious
data types. For example, to handle a boolean a client has to send `1` or `0`,
because `bar=true` would be `string("true")` on the server-side.

Data types are important, so let's not just throw them out the window for the
sake of "easy access to our data", especially as most web application frameworks
have something like `$request->body->foo` to easily get to the foo property.

WARNING: Rails is awful at this. If you have a `?foo=a` query string parameter,
and you also send `{ "foo": "b" }` in the HTTP body, then `params[:foo]` will be
set to `"b"` as the latter overrides the former. Code that you build, including
any generic frameworks/tooling that you release, should avoid conflating query
strings and body properties at all costs. They're different things and this
nonsense causes confusion, especially when you realize that `params[:action]`
means "controller method name" and actually overrides whatever is in `?action=`
_without_ anything being in the body...

.Instead of form data, use a nice JSON object.
[source,http]
----
POST /checkins HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "checkin": {
        "place_id" : 1,
        "message": "This is a bunch of text.",
        "with_friends": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    }
}
----

This is a perfectly valid HTTP body for a checkin. You know what they are
saying. You know who the user is from their auth token. You know who they are
with and you get the benefit of having it wrapped up in a single `checkin` key
for simple documentation, and, easy "You sent a checkin object to the user
settings page, muppet." responses.

That same request using form data is a mess.

.The alternative to a nice JSON object when using form data.
[source,http]
----
POST /checkins HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

checkin[place_id]=1&checkin[message]=This is a bunch of text.&checkin[with_friends][]=1&checkin[with_friends][]=2&checkin[with_friends][]=3&checkin[with_friends][]=4&checkin[with_friends][]=5
----

This makes me upset _and_ angry. Do not do it in your API.

Finally, do not try to be clever by mixing JSON with form data:

.This is nonsense. Do not do it.
[source,http]
----
POST /checkins HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

json="{
    \"checkin\": {
        \"place_id\" : 1,
        \"message\": \"This is a bunch of text.\",
        \"with_friends\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    }
}"
----

Who is the developer trying to impress with stuff like that?

=== JSON and XML

Any modern API you interact with will support JSON, or there is some fancy
binary format being used. Sometimes APIs will support XML too, especially if the
API is maintained by an older financial services company. XML is generally a
big old mess of tags, and the size of an XML file containing the same data
as a JSON file is often much larger.

Beyond purely the size of the data being stored, XML is horribly bad at storing
type. That might not worry dynamic language developers all that much, but look at this:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "place": {
    "id" : 1,
    "name": "This is a bunch of text.",
    "is_true": false,
    "maybe": null,
    "empty_string": ""
  }
}
----

That response in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<places>
    <place>
        <id>1</id>,
        <name>This is a bunch of text.</name>
        <is_true>0</is_true>
        <maybe />
        <empty_string />
    </place>
</places>
----

Basically, in XML, _everything_ is considered a string, meaning integers,
booleans, and nulls can be confused. Both `maybe` and `empty_string` have the
same value, because there is no way to denote a null value either. Gross.

Work out which content type(s) you actually need, and _stick to that_. The
Flickr API used to support `lolcat` as a joke, and that was probably the result
of a hack project in which the development team were only paid with cold pizza.
JSON is fine.

CSV can be pretty handy as an export format too, especially if your API is
offering data for any sort of "Reports".
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Whatever you decide to offer, make it very clear on your documentation what formats are supported. HTTP clients can request a specific `Content-Type` be used for the response by placing it in the `√Äccept` header on the request, and if that type is not available you can return a 4XX Not Acceptable response, which is one of many errors an API can return when a request goes wrong.

// TODO cant download http.cat right now which code is not acceptable
